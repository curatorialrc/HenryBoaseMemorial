# Henry Boase Memorial
Photogrammetry dataset for the memorial to Henry Boase, St Mary's Church, Penzance

The 3D assets created from this project's photographs were used to create a tutorial called [Real World Units: How to Scale and Enhance 3D Data in CloudCompare](https://sketchfab.com/blogs/community/real-world-units-how-to-scale-and-enhance-3d-data-in-cloudcompare/) for the Sketchfab Community Blog.

The raw images can be used to create your own version of the finished mesh. The length of the 'table' (the flat top of the memorial) is 180cm.

## Camera

A Fujifilm X-T30 was used in conjucntion with a Fujinon XF 18=55mm 1:2.8-4 R LM lens at 18mm.
